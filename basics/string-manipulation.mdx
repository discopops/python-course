## Working with text

Now that you know what strings are, let's learn how to manipulate them. Python gives you powerful tools to work with text.

## String operations

### Concatenation (joining)

```python
first_name = "Jane"
last_name = "Doe"

# Using +
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # "Jane Doe"

# Using f-strings (modern Python way!)
greeting = f"Hello, {first_name}!"  # "Hello, Jane!"

# Multiple variables
age = 25
intro = f"I'm {first_name} and I'm {age} years old"
```

### Repetition

```python
star = "*"
stars = star * 10  # "**********"

separator = "-" * 20  # "--------------------"
```

## String methods

Python strings come with many built-in methods - functions you can call directly on any string. These methods let you transform text, search for patterns, and clean up data. The best part? You can often guess what they do from their names - `upper()` makes text uppercase, `replace()` replaces text, and so on.

### Changing case

```python
text = "Python Programming"

print(text.lower())      # "python programming"
print(text.upper())      # "PYTHON PROGRAMMING"
print(text.title())      # "Python Programming"
```

### Cleaning strings

```python
messy = "  hello world  "
print(messy.strip())     # "hello world" (removes whitespace)

price = "$19.99"
print(price.strip("$"))  # "19.99"
```

### Finding and replacing

```python
message = "I love Python programming with Python"

# Check if something exists
print("Python" in message)        # True
print(message.startswith("I"))   # True
print(message.endswith("Python")) # True

# Find position
print(message.find("Python"))     # 7 (first occurrence)
print(message.count("Python"))    # 2 (number of times)

# Replace
new_message = message.replace("Python", "JavaScript")
print(new_message)  # "I love JavaScript programming with JavaScript"
```

<Note>
  Python has over 40 string methods! We've covered the most common ones here. For a complete list, check the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

## Common mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Forgetting the f in f-strings">
    ```python
    # Wrong
    name = "Alice"
    message = "Hello {name}"  # Prints: "Hello {name}"
    
    # Right
    message = f"Hello {name}"  # Prints: "Hello Alice"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong quotes in strings">
    ```python
    # Wrong - mismatched quotes
    text = 'It's Python'
    
    # Right - escape or use different quotes
    text = "It's Python"  # Double quotes outside
    text = 'It\'s Python'  # Escape the apostrophe
    ```
  </Accordion>
